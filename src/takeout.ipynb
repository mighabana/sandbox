      "[W 240920 17:33:31 activity:93] Unexpected tag! <p>Creating annotations for machine learning, especially for sensitive topics like hate speech detection, can be challenging due to differing perspectives of annotators. While capturing disagreement is important for these tasks, it can be expensive and time-consuming. We propose Disagreement-Aware Active Learning (DAAL), a technique that focuses on labeling examples where the model's uncertainty and the expected disagreement among annotators are most different. Since true disagreement for unlabeled examples is unknown, DAAL utilizes a model trained on a small set of multiply-labeled examples to predict annotator uncertainty. Our findings show that traditional active learning methods based solely on model uncertainty perform poorly in high-disagreement scenarios. DAAL, however, significantly reduces the number of annotations required compared to both passive learning (labeling everything) and traditional active learning, achieving an average reduction of 24% across various datasets.</p>\n",

      "[W 240920 17:33:31 activity:93] Unexpected tag! <p>Disagreement in annotations is natural and reflects the diverse backgrounds and viewpoints of human annotators. This is particularly important when building classifiers for sensitive topics like hate speech, where recent work emphasizes considering the full range of annotations instead of just a \"majority vote\" (citations can be added here). However, collecting annotations in situations with high disagreement is expensive and laborious because modeling annotator uncertainty might require multiple labels for each example.</p>\n",

      "[W 240920 17:33:31 activity:93] Unexpected tag! <p>Here's a more precise explanation:</p>\n",
      "[W 240920 17:33:31 activity:93] Unexpected tag! <ul>\n",

      "[W 240920 17:33:31 activity:93] Unexpected tag! <p>The slide then shows the equations for computing the update to the keypoint location. These equations are based on the assumption that the function D is well-approximated by a quadratic function in the region around the peak.</p>\n",
      "[W 240920 17:33:31 activity:93] Unexpected tag! <p>If the update to the keypoint location is greater than a certain threshold, then the keypoint is discarded.

      "[W 240920 17:33:31 activity:93] Unexpected tag! <p>This research study used a computer model to study meaning shift in online communities over short periods of time.
